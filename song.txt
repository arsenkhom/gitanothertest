Haunting Refrain

All you heard was the cry of the crone
Those words bite and leave scars
Even now the temple awaits you
Those thoughts won't take you far
You're no good so others scatter
Turn your back to others' laughter
Between the pillars it's all misfortune
Under the guise, in the name of Luna
Get a life, I can't get a word in edgewise
Give me a hand, give it a rest how you criticize
All bets are off
All bets are off

Gimme the might, gimme the inside insight
Tell me the right way to ignite this night
I see your memory in every face
It's just a haunting refrain

When the screams all have the same name
Disconnected, you fall to your knees
Between the pillars it's all misfortune
Under the guise, in the name of Luna
Tried to persuade me that
All of my troubles were blessings, and
Tried to persuade me that
All of my blessings were trouble, trouble, goddamn trouble

Gimme the might, gimme the inside insight
Tell me the right way to ignite this night
I see your memory in every face
It's just a haunting refrain

A haunting refrain
A haunting refrain
A haunting refrain

Get a life, I can't get a word in edgewise
Give me a hand, give it a rest how you criticize
All bets are off
All bets are off

A haunting refrain
It's just a haunting refrain
A haunting refrain
It's just a haunting refrain
